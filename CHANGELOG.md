# Changelog

All notable changes to everything-claude-unity will be documented in this file.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-04-24

### Added

**Fact-Gate GateGuard (three-stage)**
- `gateguard.sh` upgraded from simple Read-before-Edit to DENY → FORCE → ALLOW
- First Edit/Write on a C# file now emits Unity-specific fact demands:
  - GUID-based scene/prefab reference check via `.meta` file grep
  - `[FormerlySerializedAs]` plan requirement when renaming serialized fields
  - Public-API caller audit across the Assets tree
  - Asmdef membership check for new files
  - Verbatim quote of the user's instruction
- Second attempt on the same file passes (trust-based unlock after agent presents facts)
- Existing MVS counterpart suggestion preserved

**Destructive Bash Gate**
- New `bash-gate.sh` (PreToolUse Bash) with two-stage DENY → ALLOW flow
- Unity-specific detection: `rm -rf Library/|Temp/|Logs/|obj/`, `.meta` deletion/mass-rename,
  `ProjectSettings/*.asset` direct mutation, `Packages/manifest.json` wipes, `PlayerPrefs.DeleteAll`
- Git safety: `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fdx`, `git push --force` (heightened message for protected branches)
- DB safety: `DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE`, `DROP DATABASE`
- Per-command-hash state so different destructive commands don't share unlock state

**Atomic Instinct Learning System**
- New `instinct-capture.sh` (PostToolUse, ~10ms) logs lightweight observations with path-tag classification (view/system/model/sobject/mono/editor/scene/prefab/asmdef)
- New `instinct-distill.sh` (Stop, heuristic, no LLM) extracts atomic instincts from observations using three heuristics: warning-hotspot by path tag, tool-sequence affinity, hook-specific recurrence
- Project-scoped by default (`.claude/state/instincts/project/<git-remote-hash>/`); global scope available via promotion
- Confidence scoring 0.3–0.9 with evidence-count-based progression
- New `/unity-instincts` command (status, list, evolve, promote, demote, export, import, clear)
- New meta-skill `.claude/skills/core/unity-instincts/` documenting the pipeline

**Session Management Commands**
- `/unity-sessions` — list saved session snapshots with branch, phase, age, file counts
- `/unity-session-save <label>` — snapshot the current session.json to `.claude/state/sessions/<label>.json`
- `/unity-session-resume <label>` — restore a named snapshot with branch-mismatch warnings and TTL respect

**Meta-Maintenance**
- `/unity-skill-stocktake` — read-only audit of all skills/agents/commands for duplicates, stale globs, never-referenced entries, broken frontmatter, and stale code references

**Hook Library**
- `_lib.sh` honors pre-set `UNITY_HOOK_STATE_DIR` for testability in isolation
- New helper `unity_project_hash()` — stable 12-char hash of git remote URL (or repo root fallback)
- New state paths `UNITY_INSTINCTS_DIR` and `UNITY_OBSERVATIONS_FILE`

### Hooks registered in settings.json
- PreToolUse/Bash: `bash-gate.sh`
- PostToolUse/all: `instinct-capture.sh`
- Stop: `instinct-distill.sh`

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-18

### Added

**Structured State Management**
- Session state now persists in `.claude/state/` (project-local, git-ignored) instead of `/tmp/`
- Structured `session.json` schema with `schema_version`, `plan`, `verification`, and `agent_context` fields
- Configurable session TTL via `UNITY_SESSION_TTL_HOURS` environment variable (default: 4)
- New `_lib.sh` helpers: `unity_state_read()`, `unity_state_write()`, `unity_state_plan_update()`, `unity_track_warning()`
- State survives system reboots — no more lost session data

**Smart Model Routing**
- New always-loaded `model-routing` skill with complexity heuristics for automatic agent tier selection
- Complexity signals: file count, keywords, scope indicators, risk factors
- `/unity-workflow` Plan phase now evaluates complexity to choose agent tier automatically
- `/unity-team --quick` flag swaps opus agents for sonnet/haiku equivalents
- `/unity-team --security` preset (unity-security-reviewer + unity-reviewer + unity-linter)

**New Agents (5)**
- `unity-scout` (haiku) — fast read-only codebase exploration for scanning before delegation
- `unity-linter` (haiku) — quick validation pass against Unity rules without deep reasoning
- `unity-security-reviewer` (sonnet) — Unity-specific security audit (PlayerPrefs secrets, unencrypted saves, hardcoded keys, insecure network calls)
- `unity-git-master` (sonnet) — Unity-aware git operations (LFS, .meta hygiene, merge strategies, .gitattributes)
- `unity-critic` (opus) — challenges implementation plans before execution (integrated into /unity-workflow)

**New Commands (1)**
- `/unity-skillify` — generates new skills from accumulated session learnings with `--install` flag for auto-placement

**Benchmarking Infrastructure**
- `benchmarks/` directory with runner, evaluator, and scenario framework
- 4 benchmark scenarios: simple-component, serialization-rename, performance-review, multi-system-feature
- `run-benchmarks.sh` with `--compare` flag for version-to-version quality comparison
- Fixture C# files for reproducible evaluation

**Enhanced Learning Pipeline**
- `/unity-learn analytics` subcommand with session time analysis, agent usage, warning hotspots, file hotspots, trends
- `auto-learn.sh` now captures `warnings_fired` from quality-gate and other hooks
- `quality-gate.sh` tracks warnings via `unity_track_warning()` for session analytics
- `/unity-skillify` cross-references existing skills to avoid duplicates

**Notification System Upgrade**
- Multi-channel support via `UNITY_NOTIFY_CHANNELS` JSON env var
- Event types: `session_end`, `build_complete`, `verify_fail`, `cost_threshold`
- OS-native notifications (macOS osascript, Linux notify-send) via `UNITY_NOTIFY_NATIVE=1`
- Rate limiting per channel with configurable interval
- `stop-validate.sh` and `build-analyze.sh` emit notification events
- Backward compatible with existing `UNITY_NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL` config

**CI Pipeline Hardening**
- Settings-to-hooks cross-validation (every hook reference verified)
- Agent tool restriction validation (haiku/reviewer agents must be read-only)
- C# template syntax validation (balanced braces)
- Skill quality checks (examples, anti-pattern guidance)
- Benchmark scenario JSON validation
- 4 new test files: test-state, test-cross-validation, test-templates, test-skills

**Documentation**
- `docs/HOOK-REFERENCE.md` — comprehensive hook catalog with profiles, kill switches, env vars
- `docs/SKILL-CATALOG.md` — one-page overview of all 41 skills by category
- `docs/BENCHMARK-GUIDE.md` — how to run and create benchmarks
- 5 new README translations: Spanish, Portuguese (BR), German, French, Turkish
- Updated AGENT-GUIDE, ARCHITECTURE, MODEL-ROUTING docs for new agents and features

### Changed

- Session state moved from `/tmp/unity-claude-hooks/` to `.claude/state/` (project-local)
- Session file renamed from `session-state.json` to `session.json` with schema versioning
- Learnings file moved from `.claude/learnings.jsonl` to `.claude/state/learnings.jsonl`
- Pre-compact state moved from `/tmp/` to `.claude/state/`
- `session-restore.sh` uses JSON `saved_at` field instead of `stat` for portable TTL checks
- `install.sh` creates `.claude/state/` directory and adds it to `.gitignore`
- `upgrade.sh` migrates state from old `/tmp/` and `.claude/learnings.jsonl` locations
